    "Project Overview: \n",
    "The purpose of the project is to investigate the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and the Gross Private Domestic Investment. GPDI is the amount of business expenditures, landlord expenditures, and business inventory changes the measure of physical investment used in computing GDP in the measurement of nations' economic activity. This is an important component of GDP because it provides an indicator of the future productive capacity of the economy. If interest rates are low, the presumption is that consumers can borrow more and, consequently, invest more. For instance, lower interest rates on car loans, home mortgages, and credit cards make them more accessible to consumers. This implies an inverse relationship between the two variables and we will use time series data as well as linear regression analysis to test the hypothesis. "

    "Project Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will start by providing data reports of GPDI and US Federal Interest Rate from 1955 to 2020. The data reports will show sources of the data and how to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the project will provide summary statistics about GPDI and Federal Interest rate to show the trends of both figures overtime through visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third part of the project will compare the results of the data with the hypothesis. A visualization of the relationship between GPDI and Federal Interest Rate will be generated by merging the two data sets. A linear regression will be performed to test our hypothesis and results. The section will end with a discussion of the results and a conclusion about the relationship. Further research and analysis will also be mentioned if necessary.\n",

    "Data Report:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data of the project is collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data website (FRED). FRED provides seasonally adjusted annual rate on a quarter basis, dating from 1955 to 2020. The data can be accessed at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GPDI and https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF. \n",

    "Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key variables of the projects are Gross Private Domestic Investments and Federal Fund Rate. GPDI is defined by “Gross private domestic investment is the measure of physical investment used in computing GDP in the measurement of nations' economic activity. This is an important component of GDP because it provides an indicator of the future productive capacity of the economy. It includes replacement purchases plus net additions to capital assets plus investments in inventories.” Federal Fund Rate is “is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity.” \n"
